# Push Guidelines

- [Back to Git Index](TOC.md)

This document explains how to push changes to the remote repository in the `automation_project`.

## Steps to Push

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:

   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch>
   ```

   This ensures your branch is synchronized with the remote branch.

2. **Push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch>
   ```

   Replace `<branch>` with the name of your current branch.

3. **Verify the push**:
   Check the remote repository to ensure your changes have been pushed successfully.

## Automation Available

To automate the push, see the [scripts documentation](../../../../../../scripts/versioning/file_versioning/git/README.md).
