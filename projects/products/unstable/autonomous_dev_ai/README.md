# Autonomous Developer AI

`autonomous_dev_ai` is an unstable product focused on a safe neuro-symbolic autonomous developer workflow.

This crate is not fully production-complete yet. It contains a functional lifecycle core, policy gates, audit/replay primitives, and controlled tool execution, but parts of end-to-end autonomy remain partial.

## Current Status

- Stage: unstable / iterative hardening
- Issue track: `#647` (baseline completion) still in progress
- Design goal: autonomous-by-default behavior with policy-first safety

## What Is Implemented

- Lifecycle state machine with retry/recovery paths and terminal states
- Policy validation + authz gate before tool execution
- Risk gating (low/medium/high) with explicit approval token for high-risk actions
- Circuit breaker, rollback boundary tracking, and checkpoint persistence
- Run replay and audit logging for post-run analysis
- Structured persistence with transactional state/index artifacts
- PR flow orchestration primitives (metadata, compliance/readiness states, review loop)

## What Is Still Partial

- Full real GitHub integration for PR/review execution (current flow is partially environment-driven)
- End-to-end CI-like autonomous scenario validation with strict closure criteria
- Comprehensive test matrix requested by issue acceptance criteria
- Final documentation/behavior lock for production-grade claims

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -p autonomous_dev_ai -- "Fix the failing tests" ./agent_config ./audit.log
```

## Safety Model

- No action should bypass symbolic policy and authz checks
- Tool execution is allowlist-based and policy-constrained
- High-risk actions require explicit approval token
- Failures are recorded for replay and incident analysis

## Tooling Notes

Implemented tool wrappers include:

- `read_file`
- `run_tests`
- `git_commit`
- `generate_pr_description`

`run_tests` executes real commands (with timeout control), and `git_commit` is restricted by allowlist plus forbidden action checks.

## Non-Interactive Controls

Useful runtime controls for CI-like runs:

- `AUTONOMOUS_CREATE_PR=true`: attempt real `gh pr create`
- `AUTONOMOUS_CREATE_PR_REQUIRED=true`: fail if real PR creation fails
- `AUTONOMOUS_REQUIRE_REAL_PR_CREATION=true`: fail unless PR was created during this run via `gh pr create`
- `AUTONOMOUS_PR_NUMBER=<n>`: inject existing PR number
- `AUTONOMOUS_REQUIRE_PR_NUMBER=true`: require a real/known PR number before continuing
- `AUTONOMOUS_FETCH_PR_CI_STATUS_FROM_GH=true`: fetch PR CI/check status from GitHub (`statusCheckRollup`)
- `AUTONOMOUS_FETCH_PR_CI_STATUS_REQUIRED=true`: fail if PR CI status cannot be fetched from GitHub
- `AUTONOMOUS_REQUIRE_GENERATED_PR_DESCRIPTION=true`: fail if PR description was not generated by tool path
- `AUTONOMOUS_REPO_ROOT=/path`: repository root used for filesystem exploration
- `AUTONOMOUS_EXPLORE_MAX_ENTRIES=<n>`: cap top-level entries collected during exploration
- `AUTONOMOUS_REQUIRE_EXPLORED_FILES=true`: fail if repository exploration returns no entries
- `AUTONOMOUS_REVIEW_COMMENTS_JSON='[...]'`: provide structured review feedback
- `AUTONOMOUS_REVIEW_COMMENTS_FILE=/path/to/comments.json`: structured review feedback from file
- `AUTONOMOUS_REVIEW_REQUIRED=true`: block if no review feedback is available
- `AUTONOMOUS_AUTO_RESOLVE_REVIEW=true`: auto-resolve pending feedback (off by default)
- `AUTONOMOUS_FETCH_REVIEW_FROM_GH=true`: fetch review feedback from `gh pr view` when PR number is known
- `AUTONOMOUS_REQUIRE_GH_REVIEW_SOURCE=true`: fail unless review feedback source is real GitHub PR context

## Development Notes

- Keep claims in this file strictly aligned with current code behavior.
- For detailed implementation status and remaining gaps, see `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- Runtime requirement flags are validated at run start (fail-fast) to reject inconsistent strict-mode combinations.
