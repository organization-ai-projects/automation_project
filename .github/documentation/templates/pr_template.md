# Pull Request Template

This document describes the pull request template located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md`.

## Purpose

- Provide a consistent PR structure for contributors.
- Align with generated PR bodies from the versioning script.
- Keep required sections stable for review quality.

## Source File

- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md`

## Expected Sections

- `Description`
- `Scope`
- `Compatibility`
- `Issues Resolved`
- `Key Changes`
- `Testing`
- `Validation Checklist`
- `Additional Notes`

## Convention Notes

- Template uses editable placeholders such as `<head-branch>` and `<base-branch>`.
- The generator renders final branch refs with backticks.
- Reviewers should validate section semantics, not placeholder syntax parity.
