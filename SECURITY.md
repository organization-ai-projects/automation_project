## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities privately.

- Preferred: open a private GitHub security advisory for this repository.

- A clear description of the issue
- Impact and affected components

## Disclosure Expectations

- We will review reports on a best-effort basis.
- We may ask for more details to validate impact.
- Please allow time for remediation before public disclosure.

## Scope

In scope:

- Vulnerabilities that affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Secrets exposure, injection vectors, unsafe deserialization, privilege escalation

Out of scope:
