# Security Policy

## Supported Branches

Security fixes are currently maintained on:

- `main`
- `dev`

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities.

Use private reporting via one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
2. Private maintainer contact if advisory flow is unavailable

When reporting, include:

- Affected component/file path
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage acknowledgement: best effort within 3 business days
- Follow-up with severity and mitigation plan after triage
- Coordinated disclosure once a fix is available

## Disclosure

We aim for coordinated disclosure:

- fix prepared and validated first
- public details shared after remediation is available
