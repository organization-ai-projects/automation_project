# Canonical workspace library layer map (crate=layer).
# Valid layers: L0, L1, L2, L3, UNMAPPED.
#
# Notes:
# - Crates classified as core/foundation or core/contracts must be UNMAPPED here.
# - They are governed by core overlay rules in check_layer_boundaries.sh.
# - ui-lib canonical crate identity is mapped to L2.
