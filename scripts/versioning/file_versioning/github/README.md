# GitHub Scripts

This directory is reserved for scripts that use **only** the `gh` (GitHub CLI) tool.

## Scope

Scripts in this directory should:

- Use only `gh` commands (no `git` commands)
- Perform pure GitHub platform operations
- Work exclusively with GitHub's API/features

## Examples (Future)

- Repository settings management
- GitHub Actions workflows management
- Organization/team management
- Security/policy configuration

## Current Status

Currently **empty**. All existing GitHub-related scripts also use `git` commands, so they remain as hybrid scripts at the parent level (`file_versioning/`).
